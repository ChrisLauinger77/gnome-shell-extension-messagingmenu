# Messaging Menu

A Messaging Menu for the Gnome Shell. All email, chat, and microblogging
applications in one place.

![Messaging Menu screenshot](menu_screenshot.png)

This extension provides a convenience list of all installed email, chat and
microblogging applications with short cut actions like "Contacts" and "Compose
New Message" for email applications. The icon lights up when you receive
notifications from the listed applications, so you won't miss another message.

The extension's preferences allow you to configure which types of applications
(email / chat / microblogging) you would like to receive notifications for and
which colour the icon should change to, to indicate notification.
